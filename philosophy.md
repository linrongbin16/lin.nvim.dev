# Philosophy

## Reduce Duplications

Installing neovim with plugins/configs/LSP becomes heavy manual work.

Taking different OS/machines into account, it would be a time killer.

## Performant

Performance and scalability are the biggest advantages of neovim(actually far more performant than vscode from subjective feeling, with the same function of plugins).

Performance should always be first priority, even integrated with tons of things.

## IDE Features

UI/file-explorer/highlights/auto-complete/code-format/diagnostics/etc, these IDE features are in a chronic of starvation.

## Concise and Efficiency

Trying to cover IDE features, but not be one.

All is about editing itself, no compiling/packaging/debugging.

There're some flashy and wow plugins, but only pain-point-resolver stays, not to mention ones that seriously drag cursor and typing.
