# lin.nvim: Lin Rongbin's Neovim Distribution

{: .note }

> _A highly configured [neovim](https://neovim.io/) distribution integrated with tons of utilities for development, inspired by [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)._

Aim to be out-of-box, IDE-like editing experience, high performance, lightweight and friendly to most neovim users. Focus on and only on editing, no compiling/packaging/debugging.

Solve these issues:

- Time-cost configurations: all behaviors follow the community's best practices and most popular editors (just like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Lack of developing support: language server protocol(LSP) is supported by [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp), and [a bunch of language servers](/lin.nvim.dev/appendix/#embedded-lsp-servers) are embedded.
- Difficulties on plugin: all plugins are carefully selected and configured for the best performance and editing experience, following most modern editors (again, just like vscode).
- Duplicate installations: one line command for different OS and machines (not on Windows for now), following the same behavior.
- Naive UI - Pretty color schemes, icons, file explorer, tabs and status are integrated.
