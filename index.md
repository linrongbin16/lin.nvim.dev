# lin.nvim: Lin Rongbin's Neovim Distribution

---

> Leave vim behind, this is the next generation of [lin.vim](https://github.com/linrongbin16/lin.vim).

A highly configured [neovim](https://neovim.io/) distribution integrated with tons of utilities for development, inspired by [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).

<!-- {% include image.html src="/assets/demos/ui/start-ui.jpg" alt="start-ui.jpg" width="100%" %} -->

Aim to be out-of-box, with IDE features, performant, lightweight and friendly to most neovim users. Focus on and only on editing, no compiling/packaging/debugging.
