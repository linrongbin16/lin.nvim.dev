# Philosophy

## No-Manual

Installing neovim with plugins/configs/LSP becomes heavy manual work.

Taking different OS/machines into account, it would be a time killer.

> Note

> The installer (_install.sh_, _install.ps1_) should depend less and more customizable.
> Besides git and neovim itself, there're still some third-party dependencies can't be given up:
>
> - Programming languages:
>   - C/C++ tool chain: as a pre-requirement for other things.
>   - Python3/Pip: for vim plugins and LSP.
>   - Node/Npm: for vim plugins and LSP.
>   - Rust/Cargo: for rg/fd/bat, as greate enhancements for fzf.
> - Curl/wget: download tools for installer itself.
> - Unzip/gzip/7-zip: for LSP management.
> - Universal-ctags: tags.
> - Hack nerd font: patched-font with icons.

## Performance

As one of the biggest advantages of neovim, performance should always be first priority, even integrated with tons of things.

## IDE Features

UI/file-explorer/highlights/auto-complete/code-format/diagnostics/etc, these IDE features are in a chronic of starvation.

> 3. For duplicate ports/variants, keep the one has more stars, more active updates or newer features.

## Focus

Trying to cover IDE features, but not be one.

All is about editing itself, no compiling/packaging/debugging.

There're some flashy and wow plugins, but only pain-point-killer stays, not to mention ones that seriously drag cursor and typing.
